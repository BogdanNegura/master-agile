# Learn agile

Super! We want to generate lots of issues with the intent for the CodeTap Academy Students to pick them for copy and resolve.

## Step 1

Make sure you have the latest updates on your project, before you create a new branch.

**Note**: If you don't have the project cloned to your computer, than follow these three easy steps:

* **Star** it's a way to add to favourites in GitHub, in case you want to get back to it quicker in the future
* **Fork**(make a linked copy), the project you've selected to implement your solotion for the task
* **Clone** Clone it to your computer

It's safe to start a new branch after a fresh **fork** and **clone**, as you already have the latest updates.

# Step 2

Create a new issue on the original selected task, like in the example below:

1. Visit https://github.com/codetapacademy/master-agile/issues to pick up a task, copy it's title, like 
```
feature: simple article info box #4
```


Than create a new issue, with the title:

```
feature: [marianzburlea] [html-css] simple article info box
```

and the body:

Your text and details about the task at hand.

Original: **feature: simple article info box #4**
